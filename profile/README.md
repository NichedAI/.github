## :space_invader: Scraping RSS feeds with Full Article Content

Niched AI will automatically monitor all your [RSS feeds](https://niched.ai/docs/guide/rss-feeds/), crawl them multiple times a day and extract full article content from them.

It's a no-code tool, and you can add 1st RSS feed and receive articles in under 2 minutes.

## :newspaper: Google News API alternative

Niched AI is a great tool to replace Google News API. You can monitor the entire Internet in real-time using [Queries](https://niched.ai/docs/guide/accounts/queries/).

Queries are boolean queries you would use in Google Search to find articles. Instead of you manually doing queries, Niched AI executes them in regular intervals, and it extracts all articles from the results. 

## :file_folder: Importing Articles from a CSV file

You can manually import articles that you want to scrape, and Niched AI will process them in parallel.
